# Note: Netlify Functions have timeout limits:
# - Free tier: 10 seconds
# - Pro tier: 26 seconds  
# - Business: 60 seconds
# 
# YouTube video downloads typically take longer than these limits.
# Consider using Netlify Background Functions for longer operations,
# or deploy to a platform that supports long-running processes (Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
